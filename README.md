# Video Streaming mini-service

## TODO list

 - Clients can't watch video, stops near the end
 - If portal goes down and comes up again, clients don't update list and streamers don't republish streams
 - Heartbeat (?)
 - Test multiple streams at the same time
 - Configure ffmpeg correctly so many streams are synced
 - Find a way to deploy with Makefile
